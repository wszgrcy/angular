# Update example dependencies

Follow these steps to update the examples to the latest versions of Angular (and related dependencies):

- In [shared/package.json](./shared/package.json), bump all the `@angular/*` and `@nguniversal/*` package versions to the version you want to update to and update their peer dependencies (such as `@angular-devkit/*`, `rxjs`, `typescript`, `zone.js`) and other dependencies (e.g. `@types/*`) to the latest compatible versions.

  > NOTE:
  > The [angular-cli-diff](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff) repo can be a useful resource for discovering what dependency versions are used for a basic CLI app at a specific CLI version.

- In the [shared/](./shared) directory, run `yarn` to update the dependencies in the [shared/node_modules/](./shared/node_modules) directory and the [shared/yarn.lock](./shared/yarn.lock) file.

- In the [shared/](./shared) directory, run `yarn sync-deps` to update the dependency versions of the `package.json` files in each sub-folder of [shared/boilerplate/](./shared/boilerplate) to match the ones in [shared/package.json](./shared/package.json).

- Follow the steps in the following section to update the rest of the boilerplate files.


## Update other boilerplate files

The Angular CLI default setup is updated using `ng update`.
Any necessary changes to boilerplate files will be done automatically through migration schematics.

> NOTE:
> Migrations affecting source code files will not happen automatically, because `ng update` does not know about all the examples in `aio/content/examples/`.
> You have to make these changes (if any) manually.
> Again, the [angular-cli-diff](https://github.com/cexbrayat/angular-cli-diff) repo can be a useful resource for discovering changes between versions.

- In the [shared/boilerplate/cli/](./shared/boilerplate/cli) directory, run the following commands to migrate the the project to the current versions of Angular CLI and the Angular framework (updated in previous steps):
  ```sh
  # Ensure dependencies are installed.
  yarn install

  # Migrate project to new versions.
  yarn ng update @angular/cli --allow-dirty --migrate-only --from=<previous-cli-version>
  yarn ng update @angular/core --allow-dirty --migrate-only --from=<previous-core-version>
  ```

  > NOTE:
  > In order for `ng update` to work, there must be a `node_modules/` directory with installed dependencies inside the [shared/boilerplate/cli/](./shared/boilerplate/cli) directory.
  > This `node_modules/` directory is only needed during the update operation and is otherwise ignored (both by git and by the [example-boilerplate.js](./example-boilerplate.js) script) by means of the [shared/boilerplate/.gitignore](./shared/boilerplate/.gitignore) file.

- The previous command made any necessary changes to boilerplate files inside the `cli/` directory, but the same changes need to be applied to the other CLI-based boilerplate directories.
  Inspect the changes in `cli/` and manually apply the necessary ones to other CLI-based boilerplate directories.

- Also ensure that any relevant changes in the [shared/boilerplate/cli/](./shared/boilerplate/cli) directory are copied to the [shared/example-scaffold/](./shared/example-scaffold) directory, which is used when creating new examples (via `yarn create-example ...`).
  Only files that would not be considered boilerplate should be added to the `example-scaffold/` directory.

- Ensure any changes to [cli/tslint.json](./shared/boilerplate/cli/tslint.json) are ported over to [systemjs/tslint.json](./shared/boilerplate/systemjs/tslint.json) and also [aio/content/examples/tslint.json](../../content/examples/tslint.json).
  This last part is important, since this file is used to lint example code on CI.

- Inspect the changes and determine whether some of them need to be applied to the `systemjs` boilerplate files.

- Inspect the changes and determine whether any updates to guides are necessary.
  For example, if a file is renamed or moved, any guides mentioning that file may need updating to refer to the new name/location.

- Commit all changes to the repository.
