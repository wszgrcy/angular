 * Creates changelog writer options which ensure that commits are not showing up multiple times.
 * Commits can show up multiple times if a changelog has been generated on a publish branch
 * and has been cherry-picked into "master". In that case, the changelog will already contain
 * commits from master which might be added to the changelog again. This is because usually
 * patch and minor releases are tagged from the publish branches and therefore
 * conventional-changelog tries to build the changelog from last minor version to HEAD when a
 * new minor version is being published from the "master" branch. We naively match commit
 * headers as otherwise we would need to query Git and diff commits between a given patch branch.
 * The commit header is reliable enough as it contains a direct reference to the source PR.
